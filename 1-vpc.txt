Create a VPC with  demo-VPC 192.0.0.0/16
Create a IGW called IGW-demo
Attach VPC to IGW
Create Subnets 
public and private using https://nuvibit.com/vpc-subnet-calculator/
Create route table > private-route
Create route table > public-route
Select each route table and edit subnet associations and add public-rt to public subnet and private-rt to private-subnet
Select route table and edit routes and add route with internet gateway and add step 2 IGW
create a ec2-instance called public-ec2 in public subnet of demo-vpc and ssh connectivity from all
create a private-ec2 in private subnet of demo-vpc and ssh connectivity should be from public subnet only

do  scp -i ebs-demo.pem ebs-demo.pem ubuntu@44.201.106.108:/home/ubuntu/ from laptop terminal so that we can send the key again to private instance

use ssh -i ebs-demo@private-ip from public instance node, we should be able to login 

As we have not enabled the NATGateway, we cannot talk to internet as a egress call, from private node. 

Check ping google.com
 and
sudo apt update  > above two wont work. 

Create NATGatewayin the public subnet with public connectivity and use elasticIP. 

Go to Private-rt and edit routes add NATGateway with destination of all
now test again sudo apt update and ping google it should work.

Deletion:

Delete ec2
Delete NATGateway and release elasticIP  takes time to delete  NGW and release of EIP takes time.
Delete Subnets
delete route tables
Go to IGW and Detach from VPC and delete IGW
Delete VPC
