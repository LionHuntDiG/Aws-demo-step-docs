Create a EBS volume and remember AZ

Create a EC2 instance in same AZ

Go to EBS sections and select that newly created EBS and actions >  attach to EC2 > use custom device name like /dev/xvdf

ssh into ec2 

sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

sudo mkdir ebs-demo

sudo mount /dev/xvdf ebs-demo

 df -h

 sudo blkid  > get the UUID of new device  eg:360532fc-bffe-4ff3-9075-0ffb817ee60c

 sudo vi /etc/fstab

 UUID=ID  /ebs-demo  xfs defaults,nofail

# defaults: This is a shorthand for a set of default mount options. It includes:

# rw: Mount the filesystem as read-write.
# suid: Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits.
# dev: Interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem.
# exec: Allow executable binaries.
# auto: Automatically mount the filesystem.
# nouser: Only allow root to mount the filesystem.
# async: All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously.


# nofail: Ensures the system continues to boot even if the mount fails.


Attaching it to a different server on same availability zone

sudo umount /ebs-demo
# if above command fails  like below

# sudo umount /ebs-demo
# umount: /ebs-demo: target is busy.
# ubuntu@ip-172-31-1-214:/$ sudo lsof +D /ebs-demo
# COMMAND  PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
# bash    1143 ubuntu  cwd    DIR 202,80       22  128 /ebs-demo
# ubuntu@ip-172-31-1-214:/$ kill -9 1143

# then re-exute umount command
Go to Volumes and detach the volume and Attach it to new instance of same Same AZ, and login into new Instance

lsblk
sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
sudo mkdir /ebs-demo
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /ebs-demo
cd /ebs-demo
ls
File should be present.


Attaching it to a different server on different availability zone

sudo umount /ebs-demo
and detach it from server
select it and create a snapshot

go to snapshots and select it and create a volume from snapshot in different availability zone.
attach to server 3 on different AZ.

Attaching it to a different server on different region

 go to snapshots and do copy snapshot and select desired region > select snapshot and create volume from snapshot and attach it server and different region
